# System Design

## 5. Gaurav Sen
Once you learn how to develop backends and also familiar backend concepts the next thing is **think big** like how to develop/design such systems/backend that can handle millions of users simultaneously. Here the system design comes in e.g which kind of architecture you choose for your system, how you design database etc, and this channel is a gold mine of system design and computer science content.
