#Why learn Dynamic Programming?
	
		Dynamic programming is a technique that makes it possible to 
	solve difficult problems efficiently. For this reason, dynamic Programming
	is common in academia and industry alike, not to mention in software
	engineering interviews at many companies.
	
		Dynamic programming is a great asset to have in competitive 
	programming as its fast and efficient. In dynamic programming we hope
	to achieve significantly faster computation time at the expense of a
	modest increase in space used.
