# Data Science Learning Resources
Data science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from noisy, structured, and unstructured data, and apply knowledge from data across a broad range of application domains.


#### Following are the important subjects to covered in Data Science.
- Mathematics (Statistics, Probability, Linear Algebra, Calculus)
- Programming Language (Python or R)
- Data Analysis
- Machine Learning
- Deep Learning


## Mathematics
Data science is heavily dependent on mathematical concepts that you need to learn like Statistics, Probability, Linear Algebra, and Calculus.
#### Resources:
Khan Academy YouTube channel is the best place to learn about these subjects.

You need to take a brief idea of Calculus and Linear Algebra. And get a good understanding of Statistics and Probability.


## Programming Language
There are many programming languages that you can use for Data Science like Python, R, Scala, etc.

I shall suggest using Python. Because it has a lot of built-in libraries to use and a greater community.
#### Resources:
Freecodecamp YouTube channel has a good course for basic Python.

## Data Analysis
Data analysis is a core thing to learn in Data science. If you are using Python then you need to learn NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn libraries for data analysis.
Following are two courses that will give a good understanding of these libraries.
#### Resources:
- Data Analysis with Python: Zero to Pandas by Jovian.ai (course)
- Data Analysis with Python by freecodecamp (course)

## Machine Learning
After Data Analysis you need to learn Machine learning. For that, I have two great courses. One from Udacity where you will learn about the basics of machine learning and some algorithms. The other is from freecodecamp.
#### Resources:
- Introduction to machine learning course by Udacity.
- Machine Learning with Python by freecodecamp.

## Deep Learning
Deep learning is a sub-field of machine learning which has some advanced algorithms to deal with different problems. Udacity has a good course for this subject.
